## Description

The chrome gleam of Neo-Kyoto's skyline hides a truth darker than its perpetually shadowed alleys. Whispers on the net speak of The Arena, a brutal, underground battleground controlled by The Boss, a faceless entity who orchestrates battles between custom-coded Agents and their digital "Pigs."

You're a street-level netrunner. Your mission: craft your own Agent, register it within The Arena's unforgiving smart contract, and pit it against The Boss's champions. Every battle is a gamble, a chance to outsmart your opponent and claim their Ether.

But this isn't just about winning a few scraps. The Boss has been hoarding, manipulating the flow of funds within The Arena. Your ultimate goal? Bring them down, dismantle their operation, and siphon back enough Ether to make them regret they ever crossed paths with a ghost like you.

The clock's ticking, netrunner. Will you rise to become a legend, or just another glitch in the system?
