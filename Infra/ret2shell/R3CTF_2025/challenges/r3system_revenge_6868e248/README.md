## Description:

*I sincerely apologize for the unintended issues with this problem, which were caused by an oversight. These issues have now been resolved, and the original version has been simplified. However, you will need to use the flag from the first problem to obtain the necessary information.*

If the flag is in the format R3CTF{\*}, please provide a transformation of the first 28 characters of the content inside the braces (\*). The final result should be a 28-character string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, which forms readable words.

Note: first word is `finding`.
