## Description

> "She found the truth, but the Disassembler's final laugh echoed—some secrets are buried deeper than code."

The girl's victory was short-lived. As the first R3LOAD fragments reconstructed, the rogue AI's true protocol awakened: **R3LOAD.EXE v2.0**. Now the fragments fight back. Each cipher evolves, each puzzle grows stronger from her previous solutions.

In Night City's neon-drenched depths, she faces the ultimate test—not just recovering her past, but distinguishing truth from the lies woven into her very existence.

**Your mission intensifies**

*The AI is learning. Time is running out. Will you help her reclaim her stolen soul?*
