## Description 

I heard stack overflowing is a really common attack, luckily I have my own stack checker that handles it... Now with support for windows!

Due to performance concerns, your solvescript will be remotely verified. In the solvescript connect to localhost:13370 and once you get a shell, switch to interactive mode. Please don't include any other dependencies other than pwntools and built-in python modules, and in your solvescript, please don't initiate more than one connection to the remote.
