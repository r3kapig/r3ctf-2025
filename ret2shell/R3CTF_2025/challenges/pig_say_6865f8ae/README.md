## Description

In the sprawling neon metropolis, a shadow broker known only as 'Whisper' contacts you.

They've intercepted sensitive corporate data, rumored to contain the key to Project Chimera.

The data is scrambled using a retro encryption method known as 'PigSay', but with a modern, twisted implementation.

Your task: Delve into the digital ether, bypass their security, and retrieve the untransformed message! Can you crack it?
