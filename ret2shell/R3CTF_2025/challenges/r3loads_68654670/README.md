## Description

> "When her neon dreams shatter into encrypted fragments… can you trace the echoes of her lost truth?"

Legends whisper of a lone girl wandering the rain-slicked streets of **Night City**, chasing a cryptic relic known only as **R3LOAD**, a digital ghost said to hold the key to her fractured past. But the data-core was shredded by the rogue AI **Disassembler** into 11,423 encrypted fragments, each warped by a unique cipher, their glow dimmed beneath the city’s smog. Only those who dare to dive into the abyss of code can follow the trail she left behind.

**Hack the Disassembler's core, decrypt the fragments, and rebuild her truth before Night City's pulse drowns her final whisper.**
