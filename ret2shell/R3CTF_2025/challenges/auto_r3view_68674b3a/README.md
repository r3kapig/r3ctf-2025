# Auto Review
AI Powered pull request reviews

Simply run `auto-review client` in your GitHub Actions workflow, and the PR will automatically be sent to a LLM for review!

Once you've signed in to your GitHub account, you will be prompted to create a repository instance.

This repo contains the source code for auto-review, as well as the GitHub actions workflow that you need to exploit.

The repo will be created and shared with you by one of the following GitHub usernames:
- junron
- palindromedotorg

Ensure that you've entered the correct team token for your team.

Once you've created the repository, you can use the instancer page to monitor your LLM token usage, and reset the repo. However, there are strict rate limits on repo resets.


## Rate limits
If you run into any rate limiting issues, please contact the admins with your GitHub username and IP address.

## Notes

If you encounter a "token limit exceeded. contact admins for token limit reset" error,
Please try again. The limit has been increased to **500k tokens**.
Reconsider your approach. **The intended solution requires less than 10k tokens**.

You can check your token usage here: [link](http://autoreview.s2.r3.ret.sh.cn:33202/project)
If you do exceed the token limit again, please open a ticket and state your GitHub username.
