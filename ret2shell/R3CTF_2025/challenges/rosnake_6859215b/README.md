## Description

As the neon lights of the city flickered under the dark sky, an urgent alert echoed throughout the central server hub. A young hacker named Lyra stared at the glowing terminal in front of her. On the screen, an ancient game of Snake had appeared, but with a twist—the game was connected to the city's cyber-defense system. As she maneuvered the snake, consuming data blocks, the stakes grew higher. Each block consumed increased the snake’s length, and only when it reached 64 bits would the ultimate defense mechanism unlock.

With seconds ticking away and obstacles increasing in number, Lyra's determination sharpened. She skillfully dodged every hazard and consumed all sixty-four data blocks in quick succession. As the snake reached its final form, a password prompt appeared. Lyra entered the decryption code with precision. “Access Granted” flashed on the screen, and with a dramatic hum, the city's network was secured. The hacker's plan was foiled, and the city was saved once again.
